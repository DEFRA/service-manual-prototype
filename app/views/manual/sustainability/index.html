    <p class="govuk-body-l">
      Understand any social and environmental risks created by your service and take steps to reduce these as far as possible.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Defra adheres to the cross-government <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard" class="govuk-link" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">GOV.UK Service Standard<span class="govuk-visually-hidden"> (opens in new tab)</span></a>. All services must meet the standard's 14 points.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Because of Defra's role in protecting the environment, services must also meet this 15th point about sustainability.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Why it's important</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      Defra's services aim to bring tangible environmental benefits to our society – from improving water quality to boosting the nation's resilience to flooding. Benefits can also come from replacing existing processes that are relatively resource intensive with more lightweight and modern equivalents.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      However, the use of technology for government services also contributes to climate change and other sustainability risks.
    </p>
    
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li><strong>Energy use</strong> contributes to warming greenhouse gases.</li>
      <li><strong>Hardware manufacturing</strong> (mining and processing) can lead to water scarcity, resource depletion, and biodiversity loss.</li>
      <li><strong>Supply chains</strong> can have unintended social impacts, such as labour exploitation.</li>
    </ul>

    {{ govukInsetText({

    }) }}

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What it means</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      Service teams should design, develop, and operate their services to be as sustainable as possible, and set out their approach in a <strong>sustainability statement</strong>.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      The statement should lay out what actions have been taken, and those that are planned, against the <a href="/manual/sustainability/objectives" class="govuk-link">6 objectives</a> of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/defra-digital-sustainability-strategy-2025-to-2030" class="govuk-link" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Defra's Digital Sustainability Strategy<span class="govuk-visually-hidden"> (opens in new tab)</span></a>.
