  <li><strong>Hosting efficiency:</strong> You must demonstrate that you are resizing servers to match demand, for example by scaling down at night to reduce energy consumption.</li>

  <li><strong>Data retention:</strong> Do not store duplicate data unnecessarily. You must have a clear deletion policy to reduce your storage carbon footprint.</li>

  <li><strong>Hardware:</strong> Designs should work quickly on older hardware to prevent premature electronic waste (e-waste).</li>
